# Grasement
A simple _dungeon_ style game written in **Python 3** for the _console_

## Why Grasement?
I have a 12 year old stepson (as of this update) named **Grayson** whom I love very much and I wanted to create simple game for him to play on his computer.

Nothing fancy, just something to play on a big black screen.

I didn't want to use the name _dungeon_, I chose to use _basement_ instead.
After I realize that _basement_ wasn't cool enough, I decided to name it after him:)

## Run
`python3 grasement.py`
